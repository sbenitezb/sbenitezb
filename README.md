### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm SebastiÃ¡n BenÃ­tez, an indie and freelace Mac & iOS developer. You'll find me most of the time working on my own software or client's software.

While I work almost exclusively on Apple's platforms, I recently started my new project in C++ with the Qt6 library. It will be cross-platform and cool, but it won't be open source (at least not most of it), sorry about that.

The following is a list of my own software:
- [PopDo](https://ds9soft.com/popdo/): a menu bar task list for Mac.
- [LunarSight](https://ds9soft.com/lunarsight/): an iOS moon tracking app with ephemeris and calendar.
- [FreelanceStation](https://ds9soft.com/freelancestation/): time tracking and invoicing for freelancers.
