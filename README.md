### Hi there 👋. I'm Sebastián Benítez, a system's and desktop software developer.  Previously, I developed software for Mac as my own business but moved off Mac and started writing cross platform desktop software.

Note: I'm slowly moving my personal open source repos to my [Codeberg instance](https://codeberg.org/sbenitezb).
