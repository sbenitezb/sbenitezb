### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm SebastiÃ¡n BenÃ­tez, an indie and freelance Mac, iOS & desktop GUI developer. You'll find me most of the time working on my own software or client's software.

The following is a list of my own software:
- [PopDo](https://ds9soft.com/popdo/): a menu bar task list for Mac.
- [LunarSight](https://ds9soft.com/lunarsight/): an iOS moon tracking app with ephemeris and calendar. Acquired by [Oval Software](https://oval.fi/).
- [FreelanceStation](https://ds9soft.com/freelancestation/): time tracking and invoicing for freelancers.

Note: I'm slowly moving my personal open source repos to my [Codeberg instance](https://codeberg.org/sbenitezb).
